      "eng": "Tetsu has moved to an isolated island where his grandmother lives due to some reasons. You can't use mobile phones there and almost all of residents are engaged in agriculture or fishery. On his first day at school, he enters his classroom.... \"What? All students have animal-like ears!?\" As a matter of fact, the \"ear time\" comes once in a few days. During the ear time, all residents on the island have animal-like ears and they can hear what others think. They are already used to it, so they just try not to think about something unnecessary. But Tetsu is confused, \"What I think will be heard by everyone...?\" [From ErogeShop]"
