    "comment": "Went through a bit of a rabbit hole here as I'm not 100% certain of the ties of this song to the RahXephon movie. The original ending song of that movie is tune the rainbow which was released as a Single with The Garden of everything being the B-Side. Both songs are composed by Yoko Kanno that also made songs for the TV series but only The Garden of Everything references a reoccuring leitmotif used in RahXephon of the Polovtsian Dances.  I can only speculate that this song was supposed to be an alternative ending song for the movie, perhaps for a dubbed version but it doesn't appear on neither TV OSTs  nor Movie OSTs. I only found some old blogs saying that the song was written for the movie and an interview with Steve Conte saying that it was for an Anime, even tvtropes mentions this song in the RahXephon page. Searching this song  together with RahXephon on youtube will show you some videos claiming it is from the movie OST but they might be as disillusioned as me. ",
