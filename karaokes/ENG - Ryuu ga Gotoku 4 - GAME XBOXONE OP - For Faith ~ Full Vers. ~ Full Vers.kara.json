    "comment": "Some information for context, could be especially useful for tags: - the lyrics used for the subtitles are the official lyrics as released by the developers - I bring this up because in some parts it can be kind of hard to connect the text with what's being said in the song itself; - this version of the song was only used for the installation screen of the game; - an instrumental version of it is playing in the intro sequence and the finale; - the visuals are from the intallation screen and the intro; - I am unsure whether to use the 'spoiler' tag since developers themselves have put that video to be the first thing the player sees",
